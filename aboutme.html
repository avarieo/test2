    <p id="aboutmeinfo"> Welcome to Food First Nutrition! I'm Avarie Olsen and I'm a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist. Nutrition is my passion and that is why I hope to share how optimizing nutrition can lead to health and happiness. </p>
    <p> I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2015 with my Bachelor's of Science in Dietetics. I completed my Dietetic Internship with Utah State University in 2016 and passed the Registered Dietitian Examination shortly after. I will graduate with my Master's degree in Dietetics Administration from Utah State University in August 2019! </p>
    <p> I have 3+ years of experience working with older adults in long-term care, skilled nursing, and assisted living communities. In my experience, I have seen how balanced nutrition can affect the aging process and the risk of chronic disease. While good nutrition is essential in every stage of life, it is especially important in the later years to improve quality of life. </p>
    <p> I currently live in UT with my husband and daughter. My hobbies include cooking/baking, hiking, reading, High Fitness classes, and spending time with my family and friends. </p>
