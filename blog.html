      <p>Welcome to the Food First Nutrition Blog! I am so excited to get started. Twice a week I will be posting nutrition-related blog posts, recipes, and answering your nutrition questions. Ever wondered how much protein you should eat? If cow's milk is good for you? How many fruits/vegetables you really need? I can help you! Submit your questions to me by Sunday night and I will use them to create the content for the week.  </p>
